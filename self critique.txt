Overall I am happy with how my project turned out. I chose to style things with an overall blue theme, varying headings, and blue backdrop text boxes to highlight certain information. I felt that this made the site easy to look at and absorb information while also conveying the data well.  However, there were certainly some things I could have added or refined, namely the overall style and flow of the webpage could be amended a bit. Additionally, I would've liked to add some linking images and have a better use of icons. I also feel like this site could use a banner image for the navigation bar, and a better landing page with more content and images to direct people around the site. Finally, it would have been nice to generate some content for the additional modules that are unpopulated to give the site less of an "under construction" feel, I added html files and title pages for each of them to combat this a little bit.
