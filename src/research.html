      <h2>Realistic Research: University, Web-based, and Local Resources</h2>
      <p>This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. in Technical Communication program who want to develop, improve, or refresh their research skills. Additionally, this lesson is designed to give students strategies which will help them research more efficiently.</p>

      <h3>Content Areas</h3>
      <p>This lesson will help you learn to acquire research resources through a review of the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting Started</li>
        <li>Research Timelines</li>
        <li>Requesting Resources</li>
        <li>Local Libraries</li>
        <li>Finding Resources on the Web</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After you read the above sections, you will be directed to a short quiz which will help you reflect on the strategies presented in this lesson.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
      <p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>
      <p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan.</p>

      <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
      <p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../illustrations/research2.jpg" alt="Library Services icon screenshot">
        <figcaption>The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>

      <p>The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>

      <h2>Research Timelines</h2>
      <h3>Formulating a timeline</h3>
      <p>Consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt; Remaining time before deadline
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Let's unpack some of those terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan?</li>
        <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to read the book or article?</li>
        <li><strong>Time to integrate resource:</strong> Can you apply what you read to your project before the deadline?</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How close is the due date? Would this resource alter your approach?</li>
      </ul>

      <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time.</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
      <p>Bridgette, a graduate student in Tech Comm, decides to research the development of technical communication from the early 1900s to WWII. She searches databases like EBSCO and JSTOR through myIIT and constructs a research timeline. She sets deadlines in her Google calendar to determine feasibility for using certain resources.</p>

      <h3>Determining the Best Way to Obtain Resources</h3>
      <p>Before requesting a resource, preview it to see if it’s worth the time. If the value is clear and the timeline feasible, determine the best method of access.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interlibrary loan can take time—plan ahead and factor delays.</li>
        <li>Check how far the lending library is and how long it may take to receive books or scans.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether you can continue your project if the material doesn't arrive on time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
      <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
      <p>Some articles aren't available for immediate download. Clicking "Get Article" may redirect you to request via MyILL. You must create a MyILL account (separate from myIIT).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../illustrations/research4_image1.jpg" alt="Unavailable article screen">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../illustrations/research4_image2.jpg" alt="MyILL request form">
        <figcaption>For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Requesting a Book</h3>
      <p>Start with the <a href="https://library.iit.edu" target="_blank">IIT Library</a>. If unsuccessful, try I-Share. If that fails, use WorldCat. Always track your searches and save key information.</p>
      <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>Don't assume you'll remember every title or source. Use Google Docs or another tool to keep a list.</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h3>
      <p>Bridgette finds a referenced book, English for Engineers by Harbarger. After locating it in the UIC library via I-Share, she notes its details and schedules time to retrieve it herself after checking library policies online.</p>

      <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
      <p>There are two types: I-Share academic libraries and public libraries. Policies differ, so verify before you go.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>UIC’s Daley Library has open stacks for IIT students.</li>
        <li>Libraries like Loyola and UChicago have more restrictions.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>Don't waste time visiting closed libraries. Always check their hours and access policies first.</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Public Libraries</h3>
      <p>CPL has useful books, including some hard to obtain from academic libraries. You can visit and copy materials even without a CPL card, though checkout is limited to residents.</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from a Local Library</h3>
      <p>Bridgette reassesses her timeline and decides to retrieve English for Engineers herself from UIC. She double-checks the hours before leaving.</p>

      <h2>Internet Resources</h2>
      <p>Web resources include public domain materials, Creative Commons texts, and media. Useful tools:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> – Track citations and find scholarly articles.</li>
			<li><a href="https://books.google.com" target="_blank">Google Books</a> – Preview academic and professional texts.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.webofscience.com" target="_blank">Web of Science</a> – High-quality scientific research database.</li>
		</ul>
      <aside>
        <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
        <p>Search for special issues, edited volumes, or yearbooks to find comprehensive sources on a topic.</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h3>
      <p>Bridgette uses Google Scholar to explore citations of an article central to her paper. She expands her perspective and finds new examples to strengthen her argument.</p>

      <p><strong>That's it!</strong><br> Hopefully you learned more about conducting research and obtaining resources. Start early and go beyond the easiest sources when time allows.</p>
